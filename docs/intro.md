This is the documentation for LuxY, a Python library for working with the [Lux API](https://lux.collections.yale.edu). This is a collection of notebooks that will help you get started with LuxY. Each of the notebooks is a standalone example that you can run in your own environment. You can also find the source code for LuxY on [GitHub](https://github.com/project-lux/luxy). If you want to load the notebooks in Colab, you can do so by clicking the Rocket icon in the top right of the notebook. If you find a mistake or have a suggestion, please open an issue on the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/project-lux/luxy). You can also do this by clicking the GitHub icon in the top-right corner of the page.
